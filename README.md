MTA-MultiSeat
=============

Additional seats in GTA vehicles

To test it, spawn a firetruck, and enter it as passenger. First four passenger will be put into the backseat, fifth one will seat in 'normal' front passenger seat.

Currently only firetruck is defined, but you can add additional vehicles at [multiseat.lua](multiseat.lua#L12).

Pull requests, bug fixes and extensions are welcome.
